# Sortify
Sortify is a console based program which lets the user sort different types of files into few group of folders based on their extension type. The code is highly customizable, taking into account the user readability. 

======================================================================================|

Please read the instructions before you run the program :

HOW TO RUN:

1. Create a folder with the name "targetFolder" ( or rename the folder you want to sort, as "targetFolder" ) in the same directory of the "sortify.py" file.
2. Dump all the folders and files you want to sort inside of the "targetFolder" in no order.
3. Run "sortify.py"


=======================================================================================|

--> This program DOES :
  - copies/moves all the files from all the folder within the "targetFolder" in order to sort the files.
  - sorts the files based on their extension type.
  - maintains no hierarchical order of the files.

--> This program DOES NOT :
  - preserve the hierarchical order of the files.
  - revert the sorting


IMPORTANT : Sorting process is irreversible, so first try out with a copy of your data.
